Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several relevant breaking changes have been introduced with this release. For
the inside scoop, please see the :doc:`upgrade notes <upgrading>`. 

- Change: 'errors' values are lists containing error messages. Previously, they were simple strings if single errors, lists otherwise. Closes #210 (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: Custom validator methods: remove the second argument (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: Custom validator methods: invert the logic of the conditional clauses where is tested what a value is not / has not (Frank Sachsenheim). 
- Change: Custom validator methods: replace calls to 'self._error' with 'return True', or False, or None (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: Remove 'transparent_schema_rule' in favor of docstring schema validation (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: Rename 'property_schema' rule to 'keyschema' (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: Replace 'validate_update' method with 'update' keywork argument (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: The processed root-document of is now available as 'root_document'-
  property of the (child-)Validator (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: Removed 'context'-argument from 'validate'-method as this is set
  upon the creation of a child-validator (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: 'ValidationError'-exception renamed to 'DocumentError' (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: Consolidated all schema-related error-messages' names (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: Use warnings.warn for deprecation-warnings if available (Frank Sachsenheim).

Version 0.9.2
-------------

Released on September 23, 2015

- Fix: don't rely on deepcopy since it can't properly handle complex objects in
  Python 2.6.

Version 0.9.1
-------------

Released on July 7 2015

- Fix: 'required' is always evaluated, independent of eventual missing
  dependencies. This changes the previous behaviour whereas a required field
  with dependencies would only be reported as missing if all dependencies were
  met. A missing required field will always be reported. Also see the
  discussion in https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/665.

Version 0.9
-----------

Released on June 24 2015.
Codename: 'Mastrolindo'.

- New: 'oneof' rule which provides a list of definitions in which only one
  should validate (C.D. Clark III).
- New: 'noneof' rule which provides a list of definitions that should all not
  validate (C.D. Clark III).
- New: 'anyof' rule accepts a list of definitions and checks that one
  definition validates (C.D. Clark III).
- New: 'allof' rule validates if if all definitions validate (C.D. Clark III).
- New: 'validator.validated' takes a document as argument and returns
  a validated document or 'None' if validation failed (Frank Sachsenheim).
- New: PyPy support (Frank Sachsenheim).
- New: Type coercion (Brett).
- New: Added 'propertyschema' validation rule (Frank Sachsenheim).

- Change: Use 'str.format' in error messages so if someone wants to override
  them does not get an exception if arguments are not passed. Closes #105
  (Brett).
- Change: 'keyschema' renamed to 'valueschema', print a deprecation warning
  (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Change: 'type' can also be a list of types (Frank Sachsenheim).

- Fix: useages of 'document' to 'self.document' in '_validate' (Frank
  Sachsenheim).
- Fix: when 'items' is applied to a list, field name is used as key for
  'validator.errors', and offending field indexes are used as keys for field
  errors ({'a_list_of_strings': {1: 'not a string'}}) 'type' can be a list of
  valid types.
- Fix: Ensure that additional `**kwargs` of a subclass persist through
  validation (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Fix: improve failure message when testing against multiple types (Frank
  Sachsenheim).
- Fix: ignore 'keyschema' when not a mapping (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Fix: ignore 'schema' when not a sequence (Frank Sachsenheim).
- Fix: allow_unknown can also be set for nested dicts. Closes #75 (Tobias
  Betz).
- Fix: raise SchemaError when an unallowed 'type' is used in conjunction with
  'schema' rule (Tobias Betz).

- Docs: added section that points out that YAML, JSON, etc. can be used to
  define schemas (C.D. Clark III).
- Docs: Improve 'allow_unknown' documentation (Frank Sachsenheim).

- 'allow_unknown' can also be set to a validation schema, in which case unknown
  fields will be validated against it. Closes pyeve/eve#405.
- New function-based custom validation mode (Luo Peng).
- Fields with empty definitions in schema were reported as non-existent. Now
  they are considered as valid, whatever their value is (Jaroslav Semančík).

  field is only validated if all dependencies are present (Trong Hieu HA).
- Documentation typo (Nikita Vlaznev #55).

  Þorbjörnsson #49)

  Validator it will be validated against the supported ruleset (Paul Weaver).
  Closes #39.
- Custom validators also have access to a special 'self.document' variable that
  allows validation of a field to happen in context of the rest of the document
  (Josh Villbrandt).

- tox support.

  (Jaroslav Semančík).

Version 0.6
-----------

Released on February 10 2014

- Added 'number' data type, which validates against both float and integer
  values (Brandon Aubie).
- Added support for running tests with py.test
- Fix non-blocking problem introduced with 0.5 (Martin Ortbauer).

Version 0.5
-----------

Released on December 4 2013

- 'validator.errors' now returns a dictionary where keys are document fields
  and values are lists of validation errors for the field.

  = validator.validate(document)` you can now choose to do 'validated
  = validator(document)' (Eelke Hermens).

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on September 24 2013.

- 'validate_update' is deprecated and will be removed with next release. Use
  'validate' with 'update=True' instead. Closes #21.
- Fixed a minor encoding issue which made installing on Windows/Python3
  impossible. Closes #19 (Arsh Singh).

- 'type' validation is always performed first (only exception being
  'nullable'). On failure, subsequent rules on the same field are skipped.
  Closes #18.

Released on July 9 2013.

- docstrings now conform to PEP8.
- `self.errors` returns an empty list if validate() has not been called.
- added validation for the 'float' data type.
- 'nullable' rule added to allow for null field values to be accepted in
  validations. This is different than required in that you can actively change
  a value to None instead of omitting or ignoring it. It is essentially the
  ignore_none_values, allowing for more fine grained control down to the field
  level (Kaleb Pomeroy).
