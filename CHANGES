Cerberus Changelog

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Cerberus release.

Version 0.8
-----------

Not released yet.

- 'allow_unknown' can also be set to a validation schema, in which case unknown
  fields will be validated against it. Closes nicolaiarocci/eve#405.
- New function-based custom validation mode (Luo Peng).
- Fields with empty definitions in schema were reported as non-existent. Now
  they are considered as valid, whatever their value is (Jaroslav Semančík).
- If dependencies are precised for a 'required' field, then the presence of the
  field is only validated if all dependencies are present (Trong Hieu HA).
- Documentation typo (Nikita Vlaznev #55).
- [CI] Add travis_retry to pip install in case of network issues (Helgi Þormar
  Þorbjörnsson #49)

Released on Jun 19 2014.

- Successfully validate int as float type (Florian Rathgeber).

Version 0.7.1
-------------

- Validation schemas are now validated up-front. When you pass a Schema to the
  Validator it will be validated against the supported ruleset (Paul Weaver).
  Closes #39.
- Custom validators also have access to a special 'self.document' variable that
  allows validation of a field to happen in context of the rest of the document
  (Josh Villbrandt).
- Validator options like 'allow_unknown' and 'ignore_none_values' are now taken
  into consideration when validating sub-dictionaries. Closes #40.

-----------

Released on May 16 2014.

- Python 3.4 is now supported.
- tox support.
- Added 'dependencies' validation rule (Lujeni).
- Added 'keyschema' validation rule (Florian Rathgeber).

- Not-nullable fields are validated independetly of their type definition
  (Jaroslav Semančík).
- Python trove classifiers added to setup.py. Closes #32.
- 'min' and 'max' now apply to floats and numbers too. Closes #30.

Version 0.6
-----------

Released on February 10 2014

- Added 'number' data type, which validates against both float and integer
  values (Brandon Aubie).
- Added support for running tests with py.test
- Fix non-blocking problem introduced with 0.5 (Martin Ortbauer).
- Fix bug when _error() is calld twice for a field (Jaroslav Semančík).
- More precise error message in rule 'schema' validation (Jaroslav Semančík).

Version 0.5
-----------

Released on December 4 2013

- 'validator.errors' now returns a dictionary where keys are document fields
  and values are lists of validation errors for the field.
- Validator instances are now callable. Instead of `validated
  = validator.validate(document) you can now choose to do 'validated
  = validator(document)' (Eelke Hermens).

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on September 24 2013.

- 'validate_update' is deprecated and will be removed with next release. Use
  'validate' with 'update=True' instead. Closes #21.
- Fixed a minor encoding issue which made installing on Windows/Python3
  impossible. Closes #19 (Arsh Singh).
- Fix documentation typo (Daniele Pizzolli).
- 'type' validation is always performed first (only exception being
  'nullable'). On failure, subsequent rules on the same field are skipped.
  Closes #18.

Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on July 9 2013.

- docstrings now conform to PEP8.
- `self.errors` returns an empty list if validate() has not been called.
- added validation for the 'float' data type.
- 'nullable' rule added to allow for null field values to be accepted in
  validations. This is different than required in that you can actively change
  a value to None instead of omitting or ignoring it. It is essentially the
  ignore_none_values, allowing for more fine grained control down to the field
  level (Kaleb Pomeroy).
