This issue tracker is dedicated to bugs and feature requests.

**IT IS NOT SUPPOSED FOR ANY USAGE RELATED QUESTIONS.** 
(sorry for that loud but necessary statement.) 

Stack Overflow is the go-to place for general questions and general how-tos. On
SO, questions tagged with the 'cerberus' tag are actively monitored by the
project author, contributors and users. If consultancy there leads you to the 
conclusion that the documentation should be improved, it is a valid bug report 
here.

When reporting a bug, please post a full code example and make it as simple as 
possible. From your use-case throw everything out that is irrelevant to evoke 
the bug.

**It is mandatory to provide the information in the template below:**
