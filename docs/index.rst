Welcome to Cerberus
===================

    ``CERBERUS``, n. The watch-dog of Hades, whose duty it was to guard the
    entrance; everybody, sooner or later, had to go there, and nobody wanted to
    carry off the entrance.
    - *Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dictionary*

Cerberus provides powerful yet simple and lightweight data validation
functionality out of the box and is designed to be easily extensible, allowing
for custom validation. It has no dependencies and is thoroughly tested
from Python 2.7 up to 3.6, PyPy and PyPy3.

At a Glance
-----------
You define a validation schema and pass it to an instance of the
:class:`~cerberus.Validator` class: ::

    >>> schema = {'name': {'type': 'string'}}
    >>> v = Validator(schema)

Then you simply invoke the :meth:`~cerberus.Validator.validate` to validate
a dictionary against the schema. If validation succeeds, ``True`` is returned:

::

    >>> document = {'name': 'john doe'}
    >>> v.validate(document)
    True
