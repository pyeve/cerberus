Extending Cerberus
==================

Though you can use functions in conjunction with the ``coerce`` and the
``validator`` rules, you can easily extend the :class:`~cerberus.Validator`
class with custom `rules`, `types`, `validators`, `coercers` and
`default_setters`.
While the function-based style is more suitable for special and one-off uses,
a custom class leverages these possibilities:

    * custom rules can be defined with constrains in a schema
    * extending the available :ref:`type` s
    * use additional contextual data
    * schemas are serializable

The references in schemas to these custom methods can use space characters
instead of underscores, e.g. ``{'foo': {'validator': 'is odd'}}`` is an alias
for ``{'foo': {'validator': 'is_odd'}}``.


Custom Rules
------------
Suppose that in our use case some values can only be expressed as odd integers,
therefore we decide to add support for a new ``isodd`` rule to our validation
schema:

.. testcode::

    schema = {'amount': {'isodd': True, 'type': 'integer'}}

This is how we would go to implement that:

.. testcode::

    from cerberus import Validator

    class MyValidator(Validator):
        def _validate_isodd(self, isodd, field, value):
            """ Test the oddity of a value.

            The rule's arguments are validated against this schema:
            {'type': 'boolean'}
            """
            if isodd and not bool(value & 1):
                self._error(field, "Must be an odd number")

By subclassing Cerberus :class:`~cerberus.Validator` class and adding the custom
``_validate_<rulename>`` method, we just enhanced Cerberus to suit our needs.
The custom rule ``isodd`` is now available in our schema and, what really
matters, we can use it to validate all odd values:

.. doctest::

    >>> v = MyValidator(schema)
    >>> v.validate({'amount': 10})
    False
    >>> v.errors
    {'amount': 'Must be an odd number'}
    >>> v.validate({'amount': 9})
    True

As schemas themselves are validated, you can provide constraints as literal
Python expression in the docstring of the rule's implementing method to
validate the arguments given in a schema for that rule. Either the docstring
contains solely the literal or the literal is placed at the bottom of the
docstring preceded by
``The rule's arguments are validated against this schema:``
See the source of the contributed rules for more examples.


.. _new-types:

Custom Data Types
-----------------
Cerberus supports and validates several standard data types (see :ref:`type`).
When building a custom validator you can add and validate your own data types.

For example `Eve <http://python-eve.org>`_ (a tool for quickly building and
deploying RESTful Web Services) supports a custom ``objectid`` type, which is
used to validate that field values conform to the BSON/MongoDB ``ObjectId``
format.

You extend the supported set of data types by adding
a ``_validate_type_<typename>`` method to your own :class:`~cerberus.Validator`
subclass. This snippet, directly from Eve source, shows how the ``objectid``
has been implemented:

.. testcode::

     def _validate_type_objectid(self, value):
         """ Enables validation for `objectid` schema attribute.
         :param value: field value.
         """
         if re.match('[a-f0-9]{24}', value):
             return True

.. versionadded:: 0.0.2

.. versionchanged:: 1.0
   The type validation logic changed, see :doc:`upgrading`.

Custom Validators
-----------------
If a validation test doesn't depend on a specified constraint, it's possible to
rather define these as validators than as a rule. They are called when the
``validator`` rule is given a string as constraint. A matching method with the
prefix ``_validator_`` will be called with the field and value as argument:

.. testcode::

    def _validator_oddity(self, field, value):
        if not value & 1:
            self._error(field, "Must be an odd number")


Custom Coercers
---------------
You can also define custom methods that return a ``coerce`` d value or point to
a method as ``rename_handler``. The method name must be prefixed with
``_normalize_coerce_``.

.. testcode::

    class MyNormalizer(Validator):
        def __init__(self, multiplier, *args, **kwargs):
            super(MyNormalizer, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.multiplier = multiplier

        def _normalize_coerce_multiply(self, value):
            try:
                return value * self.multiplier
            except Exception as e:
                self._error(field, errors.COERCION_FAILED, e)

.. doctest::

   >>> schema = {'foo': {'coerce': 'multiply'}}
   >>> document = {'foo': 2}
   >>> MyNormalizer(2).normalized(document, schema)
   {'foo': 4}


Custom Default Setters
----------------------
Similar to custom rename handlers, it is also possible to create custom default
setters.

.. testcode::

    from datetime import datetime

    class MyNormalizer(Validator):
        def _normalize_default_setter_utcnow(self, document):
            return datetime.utcnow()

.. doctest::

   >>> schema = {'creation_date': {'type': 'datetime', 'default_setter': 'utcnow'}}
   >>> MyNormalizer().normalized({}, schema)
   {'creation_date': datetime.datetime(...)}


Limitations
-----------
It may be a bad idea to overwrite particular contributed rules.


Instantiating Custom Validators
-------------------------------
To make use of additional contextual information in a sub-class of
:class:`~cerberus.Validator`, use a pattern like this:

.. testcode::

    class MyValidator(Validator):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if 'additional_context' in kwargs:
                self.additional_context = kwargs['additional_context']
            super(MyValidator, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        def _validate_type_foo(self, field, value):
            make_use_of(self.additional_context)

This ensures that the additional context will be available in
:class:`~cerberus.Validator` child instances that may be used during
validation.

.. versionadded:: 0.9


Relevant `Validator`-attributes
-------------------------------
There are some attributes of a :class:`~cerberus.Validator` that you should be
aware of when writing custom Validators.

`Validator.document`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A validator accesses the :attr:`~cerberus.Validator.document` property when
fetching fields for validation. It also allows validation of a field to happen
in context of the rest of the document.

.. versionadded:: 0.7.1

`Validator.schema`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alike, the :attr:`~cerberus.Validator.schema` property holds the used schema.

.. note::

    This attribute is not the same object that was passed as ``schema`` to the
    validator at some point. Also, its content may differ, though it still
    represents the initial constraints. It offers the same interface like a
    :class:`dict`.

`Validator._error`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three signatures that are accepted to submit errors to the
``Validator``'s error stash. If necessary the given information will be parsed
into a new instance of :class:`~cerberus.errors.ValidationError`.

Full disclosure
...............
In order to be able to gain complete insight into the context of an error at a
later point, you need to call :meth:`~cerberus._error` with two mandatory
arguments:

  - the field where the error occurred
  - an instance of a :class:`~cerberus.errors.ErrorDefinition`

For custom rules you need to define an error as ``ErrorDefinition`` with a
unique id and the causing rule that is violated. See :mod:`~cerberus.errors`
for a list of the contributed error definitions. Keep in mind that bit 7 marks
a group error, bit 5 marks an error raised by a validation against different
sets of rules.

Optionally you can submit further arguments as information. Error handlers
that are targeted for humans will use these as positional arguments when
formatting a message with :py:meth:`str.format`. Serializing handlers will keep
these values in a list.

.. versionadded:: 1.0

Simple custom errors
....................
A simpler form is to call :meth:`~cerberus._error` with the field and a string
as message. However the resulting error will contain no information about the
violated constraint. This is supposed to maintain backward compatibility, but
can also be used when an in-depth error handling isn't needed.

Multiple errors
...............
When using child-validators, it is a convenience to submit all their errors
; which is a list of :class:`~cerberus.errors.ValidationError` instances.

.. versionadded:: 1.0

`Validator._get_child_validator`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need another instance of your :class:`~cerberus.Validator`-subclass, the
:meth:`~cerberus.Validator._get_child_validator`-method returns another
instance that is initiated with the same arguments as ``self`` was. You can
specify overriding keyword-arguments.
As the properties ``document_path`` and ``schema_path`` (see below) are
inherited by the child validator, you can extend these by passing a single
value or values-tuple with the keywords ``document_crumb`` and
``schema_crumb``.
Study the source code for example usages.

.. versionadded:: 0.9

.. versionchanged:: 1.0
    Added ``document_crumb`` and ``schema_crumb`` as optional keyword-
    arguments.

`Validator.root_document`, `.root_schema` & `root_allow_unknown`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A child-validator - as used when validating a ``schema`` - can access the first
generation validator's document and schema that are being processed as well as
the constraints for unknown fields via its ``root_document`` and ``root_schema``
``root_allow_unknown``-properties.

.. versionadded:: 1.0

`Validator.document_path` & `Validator.schema_path`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These properties maintain the path of keys within the document respectively the
schema that was traversed by possible parent-validators. Both will be used as
base path when an error is submitted.

.. versionadded:: 1.0

`Validator.recent_error`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last single error that was submitted is accessible through the
``recent_error``-attribute.

.. versionadded:: 1.0

`Validator.mandatory_validations` & `Validator.priority_validations`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can override these class properties if you want to adjust the validation
logic for each field validation.
``mandatory_validations`` is a tuple that contains rules that will be validated
for each field, regardless if the rule is defined for a field in a schema or
not.
``priority_validations`` is a tuple of ordered rules that will be validated
before any other. If the validation method or function returns ``True``, no
further rule will be considered for that field.

.. versionadded:: 1.0
