Funding
=======
We believe that collaboratively funded software can offer outstanding returns
on investment, by encouraging users to collectively share the cost of
development.

Cerberus continues to be open-source and permissively licensed, but we firmly
believe it is in the commercial best-interest for users of the project to
invest in its ongoing development.

Signing up as a Backer:

- Directly contribute to faster releases, more features, and higher quality software.
- Allow more time to be invested in documentation, issue triage, and community support.
- Safeguard the future development of Cerberus.

If you run a business and is using Cerberus in a revenue-generating product, it
would make business sense to sponsor its development: it ensures the project
that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also
help your exposure in the Cerberus community and makes it easier to attract Cerberus
developers. 

Of course, individual users are also welcome to make a recurring pledge if
Cerberus has helped you in your work or personal projects. Alternatively,
consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in
a while :)
