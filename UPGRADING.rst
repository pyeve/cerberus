Upgrading to cerberus 1.0
=========================


Document status
---------------

This is a draft and will be finalised with the 1.0(-RC?) release of cerberus.

TODO:

  - link appropriate sections in the docs


Deprecations
------------

Methods
.......

validate_update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method ``validate_update`` has been removed from
:class:`~cerberus.Validator. Instead use :meth:`~cerberus.Validator.validate`
with the keyword-argument ``update`` set to ``True``.

Rules
.....

items (for mappings)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The usage of the ``items``-rule is restricted to sequences.
If you still had schemas that used that rule to validate :term:`mappings`,
just rename these instances to ``schema``.


keyschema & valueschema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reflect the common terms in the Pythoniverse [#]_, the rule for validating
all *values* of a :term:`mapping` was renamed from ``keyschema`` to
``valueschema``. Furthermore a rule was implemented to validate all *keys*,
introduced as ``propertyschema``, now renamed to ``keyschema``. This means code
using prior versions of cerberus would not break, but result in wrong results!

To update your code you may adapt cerberus' iteration:

  1. Rename ``keyschema`` to ``valueschema`` in your schemas. (``0.9``)
  2. Rename ``propertyschema`` to ``keyschema`` in your schemas. (``1.0``)

Note that ``propertyschema`` will *not* be handled as an alias like
 ``keyschema`` was in the ``0.9``-branch.


.. [#] compare :term:`dictionary`


transparent_schema_rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the past you could override the schema validation by setting the
``transparent_schema_rules`` to ``True``. Now all rules whose implementing
method's docstring contain a schema to validate the arguments for that rule in the
validation schema, are validated.
To omit the schema validation for a particular rule, just omit that definition,
but consider it a bad practice.
The :class:`~cerberus.Validator`-attribute and -initialization-argument
``transparent_schema_rules`` are removed without replacement.
