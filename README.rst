Cerberus |latest-version|
=========================
|build-status| |python-support| |black|

Cerberus is a lightweight and extensible data validation library for Python.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> v = Validator({'name': {'type': 'string'}})
    >>> v.validate({'name': 'john doe'})
    True


Features
--------

Cerberus provides type checking and other base functionality out of the box and
is designed to be non-blocking and easily and widely extensible, allowing for
custom validation. It has no dependencies, but has the potential to become
yours.


Versioning & Interpreter support
--------------------------------

The Cerberus `1.x` versions can be used with Python 2 while version `2.0` and
later rely on Python 3 features.

Starting with Cerberus 1.2, it is maintained according to
`semantical versioning`_. So, a major release sheds off the old and defines a
space for the new, minor releases ship further new features and improvements
(you now the drill, new bugs are inevitable too), and micro releases polish a
definite amount of features to glory.

We intend to test Cerberus against all CPython interpreters at least until half
a year after their `end of life`_ and against the most recent PyPy interpreter
as a requirement for a release. If you still need to use it with a potential
security hole in your setup, it should most probably work with the latest
minor version branch from the time when the interpreter was still tested.
Subsequent minor versions have good chances as well. In any case, you are
advised to run the contributed test suite on your target system.


Funding
-------

Cerberus is an open source, collaboratively funded project. If you run a
business and are using Cerberus in a revenue-generating product, it would
make business sense to sponsor its development: it ensures the project that
your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. Individual users
are also welcome to make a recurring pledge or a one time donation if Cerberus
has helped you in your work or personal projects.

Every single sign-up makes a significant impact towards making Eve possible. To
