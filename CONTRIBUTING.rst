How to Contribute
=================

Contributions are welcome! Not familiar with the codebase yet? No problem!
There are many ways to contribute to open source projects: reporting bugs,
helping with the documentation, spreading the word and of course, adding
new features and patches.

Getting Started
---------------
#. Make sure you have a GitHub account.
#. Open a `new issue`_, assuming one does not already exist.
#. Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.

Making Changes
--------------
* Fork_ the repository on GitHub.
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* This is usually the ``master`` branch.
* Please avoid working directly on ``master`` branch.
* Make commits of logical units (if needed rebase your feature branch before
  submitting it).
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with ``git diff --check`` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the `proper format`_.
* If your commit fixes an open issue, reference it in the commit message (#15).
* Make sure your code conforms to PEP8_.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* Don't forget to add yourself to AUTHORS_.

These guidelines also apply when helping with documentation (actually, for
typos and minor additions you might choose to `fork and edit`_).

Submitting Changes
------------------
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a `Pull Request`_.
* Wait for maintainer feedback.

First time contributor?
-----------------------
It's alright. We've all been there.

Dont' know where to start?
--------------------------
There are usually several TODO comments scattered around the codebase, maybe
check them out and see if you have ideas, or can help with them. Also, check
the `open issues`_ in case there's something that sparks your interest. What
about documentation?  I suck at english so if you're fluent with it (or notice
any error), why not help with that? In any case, other than GitHub help_ pages,
you might want to check this excellent `Effective Guide to Pull Requests`_
